log<sub>10</sub>100 = 2\ 
<!-- how many times do I need to raise 2 to get to 100 is 2 -->
10<sup>2</sup> =  100

log<sub>2</sub>(n) = TIME (number of operations)


... You want to know how the time changes as the size of the data changes ...

O(log(n)) is 14 times faster than O(n) at scale n = 100
O(log(n)) is 33,000,000 times faster than O(n) at scale n = 4billion

O(log<sub>n</sub>) = logarithmic time\
O(1) = constant time\
O(n) = linear time\
O(nlog<sub>n</sub>)\ = 
O(n<sup>2</sup>) = quadratic time\
O(n!) = factorial time

fastest you can search something is nlog<sub>n</sub>
