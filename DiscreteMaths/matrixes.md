Multiplying Matrixes:

first row * first column

[a, b] [x] = [a * x + b * y]
[c, d] [y] = [c * x + b * y]

[a, b] [x, xa] = [a * x + ]
[c, d] [y, ya]

[1, 2, 3]

Transposing

[x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>m</sub>]<sup>T</sup>

when rows and columns don't match (eg: 4*3 and 4*3)

matrix multiplication is typically faster than other forms of multiplication, particularly because this is how computers compute data

useful for solving complex linear equations.\
linear algebra is very useful in machine learning because it allows you to break up seemingly complex or impossible problems (data sets) into chunks, and apply mathematical models to it.
