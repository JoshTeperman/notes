# Challenges

1.  Given A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12} and B = {3, 6, 9, 12}, find:

    a. A ∪ B  
    { 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 }\
    b. A ∩ B \
    { 6, 12 }\
    c. A - B\
    { 2, 4, 8, 10 }  
    d. A &oplus; B\   
    { 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 }
  



2. Write an English sentence to represent each of the following expressions:  
a. `{x | x∈`&#8469;`, x<10` &and; `x>5}`  
The set of x, where x is an element of the natural numbers between 5 and 10\
b. `{x | x∈`&#8469;`, x<4}`  
The set of x, where x is an element of the natural numbers less than 4\
c. `{x | x∈`&#8469;`, x>3` &and; `x<7}`\
The set of x, where x is an element of the natural numbers between 3 and 7


3. Write a javascript function for each of the following, which takes two sets as arguments  
- The union  
- The intersection  
- The difference  
- The symmetric difference  
(Hint: For the last one you can use calls to previous functions)

## Beast
4. Write a javascript method that takes an array as an argument and checks if it is a set (i.e. if there are any repeated elements)

5. Write a javascript method that takes a sorted array as an argument and checks if it is a set (i.e. if there are any repeated elements)

6. Compare the efficiency of the above two approaches
