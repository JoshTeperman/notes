# Functions and Relations

## What is a function?
- box with input & output
- map
- input drives output, but ouput doesn't necessarily imply input
- domain = input, range = output

## Relations
- the relationship between two or more things
- x is less than or equal to 7

1) Reflexivity
A is related to A (this is a given - something is always related to itself)
2) Symmetry
If A is related to B, then B is related to A
3) Transitivity
A is related to B, and B is related to C, then A is related to C

# Knowledge Assessment

some functin takes x
if I square x and add 10 I get output
f(x)

If we are mapping X over f(x), what are the elements in the range?
The range is the output

If we are mapping X over f(x), what are the elements in the domain?
The domain is the input

## Knowledge for Assessment


f(x) -> x<sup>2</sup> + 10

X = [-8, -6, 0, 1, 10, 12]

1. If we are mapping X over f(x), what are the elements in the range?\
-54, -26, etc


2. If we are mapping X over f(x), what are the elements in the domain?\
[-8, -6, 0, 1, 10, 12]

<hr>
(x, y) epsilon S| x > y

X = [(1, 10), (2, 20), (5, 3), (9, 2), (100, 200), (300, 300)]

3. Given the above information, which pairs are in S?

4. What kind of relation is the above question?
transitive

<hr>

5 through 7 - Give an example of the following:

* Transitive Property\
If John goes to Melbourne High School, and Michael also goes to Melbourne High School, then Michael and John are both students at Melbourne High schools
* Reflexive Property\
I am myself.
* Symmetric Property\
If Jack is married to Jill, then Jill is by definition also married to Jack

1) Reflexivity
A is related to A (this is a given - something is always related to itself)
2) Symmetry
If A is related to B, then B is related to A
3) Transitivity
A is related to B, and B is related to C, then A is related to C

x = y
y = z
therefore x = z
