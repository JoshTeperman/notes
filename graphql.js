// GraphQL is a Query language for your API, and server-side runtime for eecuting queries by using a type system you define for your data.

//! Pros

// Get only the data you need
// Single requests vs multiple requests to multiple endpoints
// Request logic created by the client, reduces dependencies on backend api versions
// Changes to request format won't break the code
